Data Origins
------------

Both the GEOGRID and METGRID tables come from the real-time HRRR on Jet, which is located here: 
/home/rtrr/HRRR/static/WPS/. These tables were also used in Eric James' 1-km ICICLE simulations.

Vtable.raphrrr.SSM is the same as Vtable.raphrrr found in WPS except that the QI field is updated.
Vtable.raphrrr.SSM.ATM only contains the atmospheric fields whereas Vtable.raphrrr.SSM.SFC only
contains the surface fields.
